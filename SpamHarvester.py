#The following Python Script is for harvesting data from Spam email headers:
#The relevant data collected from the headers is appended to a csv file: 
#From the csv file, elements, whether domain, URLs, IP, etc. Can be used to report or block. 
#Or it could be used for more interesting automated solutions. 
#Deployed as a scheduled task or cron job, it will automatically run and append to the csv. 
#This script is for personal email accounts. Prefferably an old account to use as a spam honeypot. 
#Created and Tested on Python 3.11.2 - Win 10 x64
